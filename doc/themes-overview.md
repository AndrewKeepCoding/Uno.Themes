## Uno Themes Styles

[Uno.Themes](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Themes) is the repository for NuGet packages that can be added to any new or existing Uno Platform solution.

It contains two libraries:

- The `Uno.Material` library is designed to help you use [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/)
- The `Uno.Cupertino` library is designed to help you use [Human Interface Guideline styling](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines)

Both libraries help you style your application with a few lines of code including:

- Color systems for both Light and Dark theme
- Styles for existing WinUI controls like Button, TextBox, etc.

## Fluent Controls Styles

Uno Platform 3.0 and above supports control styles conforming to the [Fluent design system](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent).
